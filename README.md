  Level 3 multimedia fugacity model for the Environmental Chemistry course in the University of Amsterdam and research. </br>
 With the Level 3 model, we reach a higher level of realism compared to Levels 1 and 2 since equilibrium is no longer assumed, but intercompartmental transfer rates are included to represent the transport of chemicals across different compartment boundaries, e.g., by diffusion. <br>
 Thereby we allow for unequal fugacities between the different media (since there is no more equilibrium between the compartments). <br>
 In addition to gaining insights into a chemical's half-life with respect to degradation and advective transport, with a Level 3 model, we gain insights into how fast chemicals can migrate from one phase to another.
